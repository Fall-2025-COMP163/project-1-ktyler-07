# COMP 163 - Project 1: Character Creator & Chronicles
# 🎯 Project Overview

Build a text-based RPG character creation and story progression system that demonstrates mastery of functions and file I/O operations.

# Required Functions 
Complete these functions in project1_starter.py:

create_character(name, character_class) - Create new character

calculate_stats(character_class, level) - Calculate character stats

save_character(character, filename) - Save character to file

load_character(filename) - Load character from file

display_character(character) - Display character info

level_up(character) - Increase character level

# 🎭 Character Classes
Implement these character classes with unique stat distributions:


Warrior: High strength, low magic, high health

Mage: Low strength, high magic, medium health

Rogue: Medium strength, medium magic, low health

Cleric: Medium strength, high magic, high health

# 📁 Required File Format
Your save_character() function must create files in this exact format:

Character Name: [name]

Class: [class]

Level: [level]

Strength: [strength]

Magic: [magic]

Health: [health]

Gold: [gold]


# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_character_creation.py -v

# Test your main program
python project1_starter.py

GitHub Testing:

After pushing your code, check the Actions tab to see automated test results:

✅ Green checkmarks = tests passed
❌ Red X's = tests failed (click to see details)

# ⚠️ Important Notes
Protected Files

DO NOT MODIFY files in the tests/ directory

DO NOT MODIFY files in the .github/ directory

Modifying protected files will result in automatic academic integrity violation

# AI Usage Policy

✅ Allowed: AI assistance for implementation, debugging, learning

📝 Required: Document AI usage in code comments

🎯 Must be able to explain: Every line of code during interview

# 📝 Submission Checklist

 All required functions implemented
 
 Code passes all automated tests
 
 README updated with your documentation
 
 Interview scheduled and completed
 
 AI usage documented in code comments

# 🏆 Grading

Implementation (70%): Function correctness, file operations, error handling

Interview (30%): Code explanation and live coding challenge

# Game Concept 🎮

My RPG world is about an 8-bit adventure through the forest. You've got to use your imagination though, since there's no visual aspect to it.

# Design Choices 🎨

When I made my stat formulas, I made sure every character has some sort of benefit to using them. I wanted both the warrior and wizard to have high stats in their specific specialty. I made it so magic increases more than strength because thats what I believe it should be. Casting spells requires a lot of mana (though I didn't use mana in the code) compared to the low cost of hitting enemies (the non-existent ones).

# Bonus Creative Features ➕

Sets gold equal to 100 at the beginning, and then increase by 100 every time the character levels up

# AI Usage

N/A

# How to run

Example usage:
char = create_character("TestHero", "Warrior")
display_character(char)
save_character(char, "my_character.txt")
loaded = load_character("my_character.txt")
